                <h3>Navigating a software interface is like walking through a modern art gallery.</h3>
                
                <p>
                  When I walk into an art gallery, the layout, the lighting, and even the placement of artworks guide my journey. I know where 
                  to start, where to pause, and how to find my way around. Similarly, in software design, the layout, icons, and flow guide a 
                  user's journey. If a piece of art is placed haphazardly in a corner without proper lighting or context, it's just like a crucial
                   software function hidden away in a menu where users can't find it. 
                </p>
                <span></span>
                <p>
                  As I dive deeper into CS, especially with my passion for UX and the arts, I've realized that designing an intuitive user experience
                   isn't just about algorithms and code. It's also an art form. Chapter 1 of "The Design of Everyday Things" truly resonated with me.
                    Just like you wouldn't place a priceless painting in the dimmest part of the gallery, you shouldn't hide an essential software 
                    function under layers of complex menus. This chapter reminded me of why I love frontend development and UX/UI: it's the beautiful 
                    blend of logic and aesthetics.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                  As I move forward in my career, keeping these principles in mind is paramount. I don't just want to create functional software; I
                   want to craft experiences that are intuitive, delightful, and memorable for users. That's the real artistry in UX/UI design.

              <h3>Using a software application is like playing a musical instrument.</h3>
              
              <p>
                  When you approach a piano for the first time, its design — the white and black keys, the pedals, and the layout — 
                  gives you clues about how to interact with it. The keys are not just affordances; they signify where and how to press 
                  to produce sound. The difference between the black and white keys provides constraints, helping to guide the user. The 
                  immediate sound after pressing a key is feedback, indicating that an action has taken place. 
              </p>
              <span></span>
              <p>
                  Similarly, in a software application, buttons, sliders, and menus are like the keys and pedals of a piano. They show users 
                  how to interact, guide their actions through constraints, offer feedback after actions, and their placement (mapping) helps
                   users intuitively understand their functions.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                  As I marry my love for the arts with Computer Science, I can't help but see the striking parallels between playing a musical
                   instrument and navigating a digital interface. The way a user feels when they encounter an intuitive interface is similar to
                    how a musician feels when they seamlessly play a familiar tune.
              </p>
              <p>
                  As I aspire to delve into frontend development and UX/UI, these concepts will be my guiding principles. I want to create 
                  digital 'instruments' that feel natural, provide immediate feedback, and allow users to 'play' without friction. Imagine 
                  designing a software application where users, like musicians, find their rhythm, flow, and even moments of joy. That's the 
                  harmonious symphony I want to compose in the realm of UX/UI design.
