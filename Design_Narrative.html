            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Okay. Let's say, in a hypothetical world, you were given the free
              will to design anything that you wanted. What would you choose?
              Would it be something personal to you? Would it be something
              you've always dreamed of having yourself? Or would it be the start
              of something you believe has the potential to be the next
              Snapchat, Uber, or Spotify?
            </p>

            <p>
              The beautiful thing about design is anyone can do it, but where do
              you start? And how you progress is where the real challenge lies,
              or for me, the fun.
            </p>

            <p>
              I started with an idea that I had as a personal project. What
              would this look like as a product on the market today? If it was
              something that I would use, then there is a market for this, and
              thus I have something that has the potential to add value to
              users.
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea was set and the design process began. The personal
              project that this design project was based on would take a Spotify
              playlist and convert it to a YouTube playlist. It would allow
              anyone with access to YouTube to listen to the same songs on the
              Spotify playlist on either YouTube or the YouTube Music app.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wanted this product because my student discount for Spotify was
              running out and as a YouTube connoisseur, I have a YouTube premium
              subscription that comes with YouTube music. I needed to condense.
              Who needs two music streaming services? So again, as a YouTube
              connoisseur, the Spotify subscription had to go.
            </p>
            <h3>User Stories</h3>
            <p>
              I CAN be a user of this product, but even more so, I NEED to
              understand the other perspective of alternate users. My story was
              one perspective of the problem domain and in design, a common
              phrase is the designer is not the user. This is the stage where I
              asked how other people would use this product and what other
              things outside of the main function would add more value to the
              user interacting with this product. This led me to 2 user stories.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Emily joins a music club at school that shares new music. They
                use YouTube as their platform of choice. She uses the product to
                move her eclectic Spotify playlist to participate in the club's
                activities.
              </li>
              <li>
                Robert wants to have all his music in one place. He currently
                listens to most of his independent artists on YouTube to help
                give them more revenue from YouTube's partner program. And other
                artists on Spotify. He uses this product to have all his music
                in one place for a cohesive library.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Developing the North Star</h3>
            <p>
              The design now has a user base to build off of. Now let's give
              ourselves a design foundation or a North Star. This North Star is
              comprised of the values that we are going to try to portray in the
              design and do well for our target users.
            </p>
            <p>
              The values (in word form) that I chose as the North Star for this
              design were: Exploration and Simplicity. I want to intrigue the
              user to explore the other elements of the product freely, learn,
              and find value outside of the main function to create a community
              for the product. This is something that I wanted to encourage the
              users to do because that is an element of making a product the
              best it can be: the community that uses it. If I were to expand
              the North Star values to three words, the third would surely add
              community.
            </p>
            <p>
              From this I decided to make two other “branches” of discovery:
              Learn and Community. These will have equal importance to the main
              transfer function in the hierarchy. I do not want to impede on the
              freedom of exploration that is our north star. There will be
              places where a user can explore and learn about different things
              relevant to music: the link to why all users would be using this
              product.
            </p>
            <p>
              The essence of SpoiTube is to streamline the musical experience
              across platforms, making it a breeze for users like Emily and
              Robert to manage their playlists. For Emily, it removes the
              friction of sharing her unique music finds with her school club.
              No longer does she need to manually search and rebuild her
              playlist on YouTube: SpoiTube automates this with precision.
              Robert, on the other hand, finds harmony in his listening habits.
              His support for indie artists on YouTube and his enjoyment of
              mainstream Spotify hits are no longer at odds. SpoiTube unifies
              his library, reinforcing his contribution to artist revenue while
              simplifying his user experience. This isn’t just about
              convenience; it's about enhancing the auditory journey of every
              music lover, paving the way for a more connected and seamless
              music-sharing culture and community.
            </p>
            <p>
              I made the target device a web application, designed to be web
              first, but with the ability to be responsive in the future. I
              think about it as this product is something that you take time to
              engage with on the web, like Medium or Reddit (where many users
              interact on desktop), but also can be used on the go on any web
              interface. I have just implemented the desktop variation in what I
              am showing now, but it is still in fact, designed with the ability
              to hold our design language on any device in mind.
            </p>
            <h3>Low-Fi Designs</h3>
            <p>
              Now that we have the elements for understanding the users and how
              they interact with the problem domain, we can get to sketching!
            </p>

            <div class="article-container">
              <img
                src="./assets/SS1.png"
                alt="Photo of Art Piece"
                class="blog-img"
              />
            </div>
            <div class="article-container">
              <img

                alt="Photo of Art Piece"
                class="blog-img"
              />
            </div>
            <div class="article-container">
              <img
                src="./assets/SS3.png"
                alt="Photo of Art Piece"
                class="blog-img"
              />
            </div>
            <div class="article-container">
              <img
                src="./assets/SS4.png"
                alt="Photo of Art Piece"
                class="blog-img"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              The preliminary sketches reflect our core values: Exploration,
              Simplicity, and Community. The interface is intuitively mapped
              out, allowing users like Emily and Robert to navigate seamlessly.
              Emily, with her eclectic taste, will find the 'Learn' and
              'Community' sections invaluable for discovering new genres and
              participating in discussions, potentially bringing new sounds to
              her club. Robert's desire for a singular music repository is met
              with ease as the sketches outline a straightforward process for
              transferring playlists. The 'Transfer' button is prominent,
              signifying its importance and utility. Both users will appreciate
              the uncomplicated layout that encourages exploration without
              overwhelming them, fostering a community of shared musical
              interests.

            <h3>Feedback and Iteration</h3>

            <p>
              The in-class peer review was an illuminating chapter in SpoiTube's
              story. The proximity of the login buttons was a point of
              contention, prompting a redesign to make more intuitive the linear
              nature of that stage of the user flow. The transfer process
              received acclaim for its streamlined approach, a testament to our
              commitment to error prevention. Yet, the color scheme failed to
              entice exploration, a vital spark that was intended but was
              missing from the visuals. Each critique was a stepping stone,
              guiding us to a design that stays true to our values while
              inviting users to embark on a journey of musical consolidation.
            </p>
            <h3>Prototype</h3>
            <div class="iframe-container">
              <iframe
                style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"
                width="650"
                height="450"
                src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FNhfQIQXKK64S8vKn22fAYW%2FCodeNAME%253A-Spotube%3Fpage-id%3D232%253A2%26type%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D234-1176%26viewport%3D109%252C291%252C0.04%26t%3DBsKexYsOMHUlIQGP-1%26scaling%3Dcontain%26starting-point-node-id%3D234%253A1176%26mode%3Ddesign"
                allowfullscreen
              ></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>
              Our prototype has undergone a good amount of critique, emerging
              with actionable insights. The button hierarchy needed
              restructuring, with a suggestion to elevate the 'Transfer'
              function, signifying it as the main thing that the site is for.
              The font sizes on the playlist transfer page were too big. The
              'Manage' button's background color could benefit from a lighter
              touch, a nod to our pursuit of simplicity. Our efforts to make the
              linear nature of the login buttons have been noted, yet there was
              still room to refine these signifiers further. Introducing a
              subtitle on the top bar was an echoed sentiment, a compass for new
              users to grasp SpoiTube's purpose at first glance as well as other
              images, logos, and the developments of “clouds” to aid in
              communicating what you can do and what the site is for on the home
              page.
            </p>
            <h3>User Testing</h3>

            <p>
              For user testing I interviewed 6 people from ages 15-29 and
              ranging demograppics about SpoiTube. Each interview took, on
              average, 40 minutes and I gain infomation about them, their music
              interest, and how they interacted with SpoiTube. I walked them
              through 4 tasks: Transfer Songs from Spotify to YouTube, Interact
              with the Community, Explore the Learn Section, and Find the FAQ
              Page. After walking through tasks, I gave the opportunity for them
              to as any questions they had and for them to give any thoughts and
              preferences on the product. Each time this was the most
              interesting part because I learned a lot about how information
              from the pre-test questions were linked to a particular desire or
              perspective on a feature. Getting more users to test would only
              improve the quality if this product.
            </p>

            <p>After user tesing I committed to some changes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Refine CTA Button Copy:</strong>
                <p>

                  action-oriented.<br />
                  <em>Justification:</em> Enhances user assurance and error
                  prevention, increasing retention and satisfaction.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Redesign Labels and Instructions for Clarity:</strong>
                <p>
                  <em>Fix:</em> Use direct text labels and concise
                  instructions.<br />
                  <em>Justification:</em> Improves user understanding and
                  navigation efficiency.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Overhaul Rating System:</strong>
                <p>
                  <em>Fix:</em> Align with familiar models like numerical
                  ratings or like/dislike systems. <br />
                  <em>Justification:</em> Reduces learning curve, enhances user
                  engagement.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Redesign Homepage:</strong>
                <p>
                  <em>Fix:</em> Implement clear messaging and visual cues.<br />

            <h3>Challenge of Design</h3>
            <p>
              Navigating the color scheme proved to be a designer's dilemma,
              teetering between minimalism and vibrancy. The feedback was as
              varied as a palette, with no clear favorite emerging from the user
              sessions and other feedback. Ultimately, I anchored my decision in
              the feedback that resonated most frequently: colors that were
              subtle, unobtrusive, yet conducive to a modern aesthetic. The
              backdrop, initially a canvas of bland white, evolved into a
              textured landscape upon users' insights. It's a delicate balance,
              ensuring the space feels alive without veering into visual noise.
              This journey underscored a cardinal design truth—empathy overrides
              personal preference, and the user's voice is the guiding light.
            </p>
            <p>
              The top bar, a compass for navigation, was a challenge of
              restraint and foresight. Every element had to justify its
              presence, every icon a purpose. The decision-making was meticulous
              and involved tracing user journeys and aligning them with our
              North Star values. The button copy, initially not sufficient,
              evolved through the feedback to strike a balance between brevity
              and clarity, ensuring each word guided the user intuitively.
            </p>
            <p>
              The triad of the main pages—Transfer, Learn, Community—stands firm
              in its commitment to our values. It represents the freedom
              intrinsic to our design, a freedom we chose not to compromise.
            </p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
              Reflecting on the SpoiTube project, it's been a profound journey
              from a personal need to a service that can touch the lives of
              many. The process was as much about understanding others as it was
              about translating my needs into a universal solution. With every
              sketch and prototype iteration, the values of Exploration,
              Simplicity, and Community became more ingrained in the design,
              guiding each decision towards a product that's not just
              functional, but also a joy to use. It's been a reminder that
              design is never static; it's a living process that evolves with
              its users. SpoiTube stands as a testament to the idea that a
              designer's work is never done; there's always room to grow, to
              adapt, and to anticipate the future needs of our ever-expanding
              community of music lovers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Design is a journey without a final destination. While SpoiTube
              now encapsulates a moment of completion, the reality is that it's
              merely a snapshot of an ongoing evolution. The future beckons with
              further user testing, each session a potential goldmine for
              insights. The quest for refinement is relentless. Building out of
              the current framework, the design will adapt, morph, and
              grow—responsive not just in screen size, but to the ever-changing
              landscape of user needs and technological advances. SpoiTube's
              design lifecycle mirrors life, cyclical and perpetual, with every
              iteration a rebirth of ideas and possibilities.
