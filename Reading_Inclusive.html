            <h3>Chapter 12 of "Don't Make Me Think"</h3>
            <p>
              Sometimes when making websites or apps, designers and developers
              worry about adding features for people with disabilities because
              they think it will take more time and make their design less
              attractive to most users. They also worry about things called
              "tech debt," which is like a pile of chores that keep growing if
              they don't fix or update parts of their project. When they add new
              features, sometimes old parts don't work well with the new parts,
              adding to the tech debt pile. Making designs that are good for
              everyone, including people with disabilities, is very important
              but can feel like a big extra task. Sometimes, these good features
              don't get added because the team is worried about the growing pile
              of chores or they're rushing to finish the project. This shows why
              it's important to plan for making things accessible to everyone
              from the start, so it doesn't become a big worry later on.

              <p>
                In situations where you encounter a device you've never seen
                before but need to use it to accomplish a specific goal, a
                structured approach can help overcome the unfamiliarity and
                enable successful interaction with the device.
              </p>
              <ol style="margin-left: 20px">
                <li>
                  <strong>Develop a Theoretical Model:</strong> Formulate a
                  basic understanding or a theoretical model of how you think
                  the device should operate based on your prior knowledge and
                  experiences with similar devices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Inspect the Device:</strong> Inspect the device for
                  visible signs, labels, or indicators that might guide you on
                  how to use it. Look for common design elements like buttons,
                  switches, or touchscreens that are used in similar devices you
                  are familiar with.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Match Actions to Visible Signs:</strong> Try to match
                  the actions you think are needed to accomplish your goal with
                  the visible signs you have identified on the device. For
                  instance, if you need to turn on a device, look for a common
                  signifier like a power button.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Experiment and Iterate:</strong> If the device doesn’t
                  respond as expected, don’t hesitate to try different actions
                  or look for additional signifiers that might help. It’s a
                  process of trial and error to understand how the device
                  operates.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Seek Guidance if Necessary:</strong> If available,
                  seek guidance from manuals, online resources, or individuals
                  familiar with the device. This can expedite the learning
                  process and help you accomplish your goal quicker.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                This tutorial outlines a systematic approach to interacting with
                unfamiliar devices to accomplish specific goals, embodying the
                essence of exploring and understanding the affordances and
                signifiers presented by the device to make the interaction
                intuitive and goal-oriented.
