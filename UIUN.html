            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Imagine a summit where designers from around the globe converge,
              not just to share ideas but to forge a path towards a more
              accessible digital world. This was the essence of the UIUN Summit.
              It served as a melting pot of creativity and advocacy in the realm
              of UI accessibility. Our challenge? To rethink the user interface
              of the Sarpy County election commission site, specifically
              focusing on streamlining the process of registering for a mail-in
              ballot.
            </p>

            <h3>Representing the Intellectual Disabilities Community</h3>
            <p>
              As a representative of the intellectual disabilities community, I
              was tasked with addressing their unique UI/UX needs. This
              demographic experiences the world in a way that often requires a
              more intuitive and straightforward digital navigation. Their needs
              are specific yet universal: content with a Flesch Kincaid reading
              ease score of 90 or above for clear understanding, a simplified
              display to avoid overwhelming the user, a guided process with
              visual aids for multi-step tasks, and large, easily interactable
              elements for those with motor impairments. These requirements,
              while tailored for this community, have a universal appeal,
              simplifying digital interaction for all users.
            </p>

            <h3>The Summit: Negotiating and Prioritizing</h3>
            <p>
              The summit was full negotiations and collaborations. We were
              tasked with the task of prioritizing the collective requirements
              of all groups. It was a delicate balancing act â€“ advocating for
              our community's needs while ensuring the final design didn't
              exclude others. The most intriguing part was witnessing the
              defense of specific requirements that could easily have been
              broadened to encompass a wider range of needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              My proposal found natural allies in teams representing rural
              communities, PTSD, and anxiety sufferers. Our combined advocacy
              led to significant priority changes, highlighting the universality
              of our design principles.
            </p>

            <h3>Insights and Reflections</h3>
            <p>
              The highlight for me was observing the debate and eventual
              resolution between the rural and Gen Z representatives,
              particularly over issues like internet load time. This discussion
              underscored the importance of considering a diverse range of needs
              in UI design.
            </p>
            <p>
              My greatest takeaway from the summit is the concept that inclusive
              design is about not excluding anyone. It may seem
              counterintuitive, but focusing on not leaving anyone out, rather
              than on including specific groups, leads to more universally
              accessible designs. This experience was a real-world emulation of
              the dynamics in UI design teams, emphasizing the iterative and
              collaborative nature of the design process.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              The UIUN Summit was more than just a design exercise; it was full
              of representations of the challenges and triumphs that happen in
              the field of UI/UX. It reinforced the idea that creating digital
              spaces that are accessible and user-friendly for everyone is not
              just a noble goal but an achievable one. The insights gained here
              are not just theoretical but practical tools that I intend to
              carry forward in my journey in design.
